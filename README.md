# Dash-Heat

The project aim to control with a Raspberry PI the way your home will heat.
The project will mainly be in Python. Just because i like it.

The first goal is to get myself a first prototype for my type of heating solution.
Then I will devlop for some other installations.

There will be an Android application and an internet Dashboard.

The project aim to be the cheaper possible.
